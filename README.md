# KELctl
This is a Python 3 library to provide easier means of controlling a Korad KEL103 electronic load over a serial connection. It will probably also work with a KEL102 load but this is untested.
I would recommend, in addition to this documentation, to also check the test.py file for examples on hwo to use the library. Additionally more details about certain aspects on how the load works are provided in the KEL-103 protocol documentation.

It uses the [aenum library](https://github.com/ethanfurman/aenum).
The minimum required python version required is 3.10.

This library has been initially copied from the [py-korad-serial project](https://github.com/starforgelabs/py-korad-serial) and been modified to work with the electronic loads instead of power supplies.

## Python package

The library is available as a package at PyPI as [py-kelctl](https://pypi.org/project/py-kelctl/).

## Hardware
The [ Korad KEL103/KEL102 ](https://www.koradtechnology.com/product/81.html) is sold under different names and brands i.e. RND 320-KEL103.


# Usage
Examples for basic usage of all functions are included in the test.py file.

The object supports the python `with` statement to release the serial
port automatically:

```
from KELSerial import KELSerial

with KELSerial('/dev/ttyACM0') as load:
    print("Model: ", load.model)
    print("Status: ", load.status)
```


# Class  Documentation

### `BaudRate` class

Represents the available baud rates the device operates in to provide a single type of value for the different ways the load outputs it in.
Due to using a MultiValueEnum you can get both values from the Enum like this:

```
rate = BaudRate.R57600
print("First Value: ", rate.a)
print("Second Value: ", rate.b)
```

The following rates are included:
```
R9600 = (0, 9600)
R19200 = (1, 19200)
R38400 = (2, 38400)
R57600 = (3, 57600)
R115200 = (4, 115200)
```
___

### `OnOffState` class

Represents the on/off state to provide a single type of value for the different ways the load outputs it in.
Due to using a MultiValueEnum you can get both values from the Enum like this:

```
state = OnOffState.on
print("First Value: ", state.a)
print("Second Value: ", state.b)
```

The following rates are included:
```
off = (0, "OFF")
on = (1, "ON")
```

## Custom Errors

### `InvalidModeError` class

This exception is raised when trying to get a mode that is not currently set. For example if the current mode is not a dynamic mode, trying to get the information from a dynamic mode will result in this error since the unit can only return a dynamic mode that is set and recalled.

The error will return both the `mode` the load currently operates in and a `message`.
___

### `ValueOutOfLimitError` class

This exception is raised for errors in the input value. Since there apparently exists a firmware bug allowing setting values above limits for resistance and power(see protocol docs) the library will check and limit values itself and raise this error if trying to set values outside of limits.

The error will return the `value` that was tried to be set, the `limit` that is currently set and a `message`
___

### `NoModeSetError` class

This exception is raised when trying to set a mode that does not support being set directly(read-only in [Mode](#mode-class)-Enum).

The error will return the `mode` that was tried to be set and a `message`.
